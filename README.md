# weather-converter
A simple JS app that converts weather to different metric systems

A simple project again from Codecademy.

The app essentially take an input using the Kelvin weather metric system. 
It then does the following: 

- Convert Kelvin to Celcius
- Convert celcius to fahrenheit
- **As a bonus Convert celcius to Newton's**
